# TALs

Most of the Trust Anchor Locators of the RIRs are included here for convenience. (But maybe you should get your own, for security.)

The only one that's not included is ARIN's, because you need to agree to their [RPA](https://www.arin.net/resources/manage/rpki/tal/).

In order to ease the ARIN TAL download, there's a script that does that for you: [fort_setup.sh](https://github.com/NICMx/FORT-validator/blob/master/fort_setup.sh). Read more about it at web docs section [Compilation and Installation](https://nicmx.github.io/FORT-validator/installation.html).
