# Fort's website

This directory contains the source files of Fort's site and documentation.

On account on not being finished, Github does not automatically compile+serve this yet.

You can compile the documentation yourself by running [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) right here.

```bash
$ jekyll build
```

Have a look at your generated files in the new `_site/` directory. (Start at `index.html`.)
